/*
Problem Statement:
Write a Scala program for the given tasks:
Q1. Write a Scala program that reads a number(dynamic) and display its
    square, cube, and fourth power.
Q2. Write a Scala program to check the given number is a prime number or not.
    (Number can be static or dynamic).
Q3. Create Student object with the main method. The variable studmarks is 
    initialized with a value of 75. In the if block, if the marks is greater 
    than 65 then the marks is incremented by 20 and the statement 
    “student passed the exam with distinction” is printed. Since the marks is 
    initialized to 75 which is greater than 65 the if loop statements are executed.
